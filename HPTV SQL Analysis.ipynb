    "## Crunchbase Startup Profile Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's fast-paced world, startups are growing at an unprecedented rate, and their contributions to the economy are becoming increasingly significant. However, managing information on startups is a complicated task due to the enormous amount of data generated by these organizations. Fortunately, tools such as SQL are highly effective at parsing through and analyzing large datasets, making it easier to analyze and compare data from a broad range of sources.\n",
    "In this SQL project, I will be analyzing Crunchbase Startup profile data, a database consisting of information on thousands of startups worldwide. With the help of SQL queries, we will explore various questions such as:\n",
    "- What are the top industries by funding amount, and how have they changed over time?\n",
    "- Which country has the most funding for startups?\n",
    "- What is the correlation between the amount of funding received and the number of employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering these questions, we will gain invaluable insights into the trends and patterns that exist within the startup ecosystem. This project will aim to demonstrate the power of SQL in organizing and extracting valuable insights from large datasets, providing entrepreneurs, investors, and analysts alike with the tools needed to make informed decisions.\n"
